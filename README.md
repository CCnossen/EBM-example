This repo contains an operational example of a python code leveraging data from the Binance and Yahoo finance API endpoints to run an Explainable Boosting Machine model. 

The included scripts run some feature engineering to determine if a weekly large move in BTC price can be predicted. The script outputs confusion matrices and some precision/recall statistics to determine how well the model performs (spoiler: not good enough)
